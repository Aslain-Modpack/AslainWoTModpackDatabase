Subject: Relhax bug fix status update

Hello username of server!
(This is a copy and paste message)
I am writing to inform you that your bug, "bugname", has had its status determined to be 'invalid'. This is most likely because you did not provide the required files to debug and solve the problem (relHaxLog.txt, installed config preference file, etc.).
While I want to fix the problem you are having, I need those files to be able to replicate and/or investigate your problem further.
For where to upload your files, you can use any of the following: (or any other, if you have a personal favorite)
  -your dropbox account (make sure you enable sharing on the file and copy paste the link)
  -your google drive account (same as above)
  -pastebin (https://pastebin.com/) (copy paste the link)
  -bilder upload (http://www.bilder-upload.eu/) (copy paste the link)

For purposes of not clogging up the spreadsheet, if you do not provide the required files in the next week, the bug will be deleted.
If you have questions, fell free to reply to this message. You can also see the updated bug status in the spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LmPCMAx0RajW4lVYAnguHjjd8jArtWuZIGciFN76AI4/edit?usp=sharing

Thanks for using Relhax!
