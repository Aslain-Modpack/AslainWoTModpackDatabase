Disabled:

-SafeShot (Breaks halloween game mode)

Removed:

Notes:
-Re-enabled "Max Farplane and Delete Fog" mods, their legal status has been renewed
-We have disabled autoAim, balcalc, SafeShot because they break the halloween game mode. Yes, they work in regular pub matches, but here at the relhax modpack team our first priority is the stability of mods in the game. As fellow players, the last thing we want to happen is that someone looses a game because of mod issues. It will be re-enabled after the game mode is over. Thank you for understanding.
