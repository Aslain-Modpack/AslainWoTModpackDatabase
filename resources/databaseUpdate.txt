Notes:
 - Official testing will be done next week, this is an initial release that may have issues. Please report them to us if you find any.
 - Some packages have not yet been updated, but will not break the game. They have been left enabled and will be updated later when the team has time.
 - Some packages have not yet been updated and have been disabled until the team has time to update them.
 - Some packages have been removed because the team does not have time to update them anymore (we lost a couple team members).
